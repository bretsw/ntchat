## Description

This presentation describes participation in Twitter #ntchat (i.e., “new teacher chat”) using a mix of quantitative methods and qualitative content analysis. Surprisingly, results showed that new teachers are not the main contributors to #ntchat. This session will be of interest to researchers studying online learning and anyone working to support teachers’ or instructional design and technology (IDT) professionals’ growth. Presenters will facilitate discussion among attendees regarding various online spaces for supporting professional development and methods for studying them.

## Extended Abstract

### Introduction and Background

This proposal reports a Category 2 work-in-progress on new teachers’ online professional development; specifically, the purpose of this presentation is to describe participation in Twitter #ntchat (i.e., “new teacher chat”). 

Since its inception in 2006, Twitter has gained momentum as an online platform for educators’ professional development. In a study by Visser, Evering, and Barrett (2014), teachers reported using Twitter for professional use more often than personal use. Carpenter and Krutka (2015) found that teachers enjoy using Twitter for professional growth and development because it allows them to stay on top of educational trends and connect with educators outside of their face-to-face network. 

One way teachers can connect on Twitter is through Twitter “chats,” which Carpenter and Krutka (2014) defined as: “synchronous events where many users participate in a discussion via tweets on a specific topic, usually using a predetermined hashtag at a designated time” (p. 12). In particular, one education-related Twitter chat, #ntchat, was started in 2010 “to provide weekly mentoring and focus on the needs of new, new to the profession and pre-service teachers.” Synchronous discussions on #ntchat occur Wednesdays from 8:00-9:00pm EST; however, Twitter users can post using the hashtag anytime.  Research has shown that online spaces like #ntchat provide new teachers opportunities for induction (Zuidema, 2012), empathetic support (Hur & Brush, 2009), and mentoring (Smith Risser, 2013)—all of which are critical for new teachers. 

The purpose of this study was to examine Twitter #ntchat to understand more about participants and how they are using the space. Specifically, two research questions guided this study: RQ1. What are participants doing in #ntchat? RQ2. Who is contributing to #ntchat? 

### Method and Results

Tweets containing the text “#ntchat” were collected with a Twitter Archiving Google Sheet (Hawksey, 2014) during a period of nine months, from May 1, 2018 to January 31, 2019. More complete metadata (e.g., tweet type, tweeter profile information) were obtained using the “rtweet” package (Kearney, 2018) in R. Subsequent statistical analyses were also completed using R.

### RQ1. What are participants doing in #ntchat? 
During the nine months of #ntchat tweets, 11,735 different tweeters created 28,098 unique tweets. To focus on what new teachers might be contributing to #ntchat, “retweets” (i.e., sharing a tweet to one’s own Twitter timeline, which could be considered more a form of rebroadcasting than original contribution) were removed from the dataset. The remaining tweets (minus retweets) roughly fell into categories of “original posts” and “replies;” the new dataset contained 7,596 (28.32% of all tweets) unique tweets from 992 (8.45% of all tweeters) different tweeters. The mean contribution of tweets per tweeter was 8.02 (SD=44.30), with a median of one. Approximately half (53.12%) of contributors only tweeted to #ntchat once in nine months, and 89.31% tweeted nine times or less—meaning 10.69% tweeted an average of monthly. In terms of engagement with #ntchat posts and replies, approximately half (54.85%) were retweeted; the mean retweets per tweet was 2.81 (SD=17.18). More than two-thirds (69.33%) of #ntchat posts and replies received “likes;” the mean likes per tweet was 5.77 (SD=35.14). 

To conduct content analysis, 200 tweets were randomly sampled from #ntchat posts and replies. An “a priori” coding scheme (Authors, in revision) was used to categorize groups of tweets related to: (a) “self,” such as promoting one’s own work; (b) “others,” such as highlighting the work of peers; (c) “mutual engagement,” such as discussing ideas or collaborating; and (d) “miscellaneous,” which included anything not captured by the first three categories—such as news, didactic content, and tweets that were off topic. Approximately half (49.00% ± 9.61%—the margin of error represents a 95% confidence interval) of the #ntchat sample tweets were related to self, approximately one-third (36.00% ± 9.23%) were related to others, 15.00% ± 6.86% were related to mutual engagement, and none were categorized as miscellaneous. The percent agreement between the two coders was 84.50%, and Cohen’s kappa was .75—suggesting substantial agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977).

### RQ2. Who is contributing to #ntchat? 
Using the same random sample of 200 tweets as above, 104 tweeters were identified for content analysis of their Twitter profiles. Self-identified pre-service and newly in-service teachers rarely contributed to #ntchat (5.77% ± 4.48%); neither did teacher educators (2.88% ± 3.21%). The most significant categories of contributors to #ntchat were educational technology companies and organizations (35.58% ± 9.20%) and educational consultants, speakers, authors, and trainers (31.73% ± 8.95%). Broad categories of “teacher” (22.12% ± 7.98%) and “administrator” (11.54% ± 6.14%) were also present. Most Twitter profiles were able to be coded—only 1.92% ± 2.64% were placed in the “other/unknown” category. Because these categories were not mutually exclusive, IRR scores were calculated for each category. Percent agreement ranged from 91.35% to 98.08% and Cohen’s kappa scores ranged from .71 to .96—substantial to almost perfect agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977).

### Conclusion

Perhaps unsurprisingly, Twitter #ntchat demonstrated “participation inequality” common to online social spaces. More unexpected was how infrequently users self-identifying as “new teachers” contributed to new teacher chat. Instead, #ntchat seemed to be dominated by users—largely ed tech companies, organizations, and consultants—promoting their own “brand” content far more than interacting with new teachers. Teachers might still find benefit from #ntchat as a content source, but less likely as a space to interact with peers or receive active mentoring.

The strength of this study’s approach is that there were few initial assumptions about what users are doing in #ntchat—a multiple methods approach offered more insight than looking at descriptive statistics or tweet content alone. Researchers might find this study’s combination of quantitative methods and qualitative content analysis to be useful, but future research should also include surveys or interviews to provide a deeper understanding of how the participants perceive benefits of #ntchat.
