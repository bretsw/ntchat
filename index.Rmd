# Method

---

# Data Collection

* We collected tweets with a `Twitter Archiving Google Sheet (TAGS)` (Hawksey, 2014)

--
  * all tweets containing the keyword text "#ntchat"

--

  * May 1, 2018 to October 1, 2019 (17 months)

--

* We obtained tweet metadata using the `rtweet` R package (Kearney, 2018)

---

# Data Analysis

### Quantitative Analysis

--

* We calculated statistical analyses using R

---

# Data Analysis

### Qualitative Analysis of Tweets

--

* We randomly sampled 200 tweets from #ntchat posts and replies
  
--

* We used an a priori coding scheme (see Staudt Willet, 2019) 
  
--

* Categories of tweet purposes related to:
  1. *self* - promoting one’s own work
  1. *others* - highlighting the work of peers
  1. *mutual engagement* - discussing ideas or collaborating
  1. *miscellaneous* - anything not captured by the first three categories—such as news, didactic content, and tweets that were off topic

--

* We checked inter-rater reliability (IRR):

--

  * *percent agreement* was 84.50%
  * *Cohen’s kappa* was .75, suggesting substantial agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977)

---

# Data Analysis

### Qualitative Analysis of Tweeters

--

* We used the same random sample of 200 #ntchat tweets, resulting in 104 tweeters

--

* Categories of tweeters:
  1. *pre-service and newly in-service teachers*
  1. *teacher educators*
  1. *educational technology companies and organizations*
  1. *teacher*
  1. *administrator*
  1. *other/unknown*

--

* We checked inter-rater reliability (IRR):

--

  * because categories were not mutually exclusive, IRR scores were calculated for each category
  * *percent agreement* ranged from 91.35% to 98.08%
  * *Cohen’s kappa* ranged from .71 to .96, suggesting substantial to almost perfect agreement (Landis & Koch, 1977)
